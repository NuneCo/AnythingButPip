For now, this will be Woozle's loose notes on the issues around documentation and the current plan of using Markdown in a Git repository as the primary methodology. It may eventually evolve into â‰¥1 more formalized documents.

## Atom
* ...is kind of terrible in some ways.
  * Preview function:
    * Have to activate it for each new document
    * sometimes live-updates, sometimes doesn't
      * (maybe multiple copies of same source are open, and I'm viewing the wrong one?)
    * menu-path for doing so is counterintuitive & not easily discoverable
    * switching tabs to another source-document does not switch to the corresponding preview (except sometimes)
    * doesn't show what URLs are being generated by links, much less attempt to navigate to them
* ...is also not-terrible
  * responsive
  * directory view (all files in project shown as tree) is intuitive for me
  * "save all files" is good (same as Kate)
    * **caveat:** no default shortcut key
      * **caveat:** instructions for modifying the key-bindings did not work
  * auto-indent works sensibly

Because of the lack of link preview/test, it's basically necessary to push the repo up to a web-based UI in order to test the links.

## Markdown
* Indentation markup is inconsistent/ambiguous in some cases (indent in source [here](2019-09-01 08-41-52.screenshot.indentation.png) is not rendering as an indent), and may be rendered differently by different software.
* **Questions**:
  * Is there any way to caption an image? (as in MW)
  * Are templates a thing? (as in MW)
* **Would be nice**:
  * Some kind of automatic table-of-contents generator
    * preferably invoked by a tag of some sort in the text so it can be placed appropriately.
      * ideally, the tag should allow specifying a mask of files to index, and there should be a "title" tag that documents could use to specify the link-text to use

## Gitea
* Is it extendable/pluggable?
