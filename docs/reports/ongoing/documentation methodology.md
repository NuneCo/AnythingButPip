For now, this will be Woozle's loose notes on the issues around documentation and the current plan of using Markdown in a Git repository as the primary methodology. It may eventually evolve into â‰¥1 more formalized documents.

## Atom
* ...is kind of terrible in some ways.
 * Preview function:
  * Have to activate it for each new document
  * sometimes live-updates, sometimes doesn't
   * (maybe multiple copies of same source are open, and I'm viewing the wrong one?)
  * menu-path for doing so is counterintuitive & not easily discoverable
  * switching tabs to another source-document does not switch to the corresponding preview
* ...is also not-terrible
 * responsive
 * directory view (all files in project shown as tree) is intuitive for me
 * "save all files" is good (same as Kate)
  * **caveat:** no default shortcut key
   * **caveat:** instructions for modifying the key-bindings did not work
