# About

**Anything But [Pip](https://wiki.hypertwins.org/Pip)** (ABP) is the working title for a project to meet the immediate resource needs of the team so that we can spend more time moving forward with mission-related work and less time struggling to meet basic existential needs.

For now, [the wiki](https://gitlab.com/woozalia/anythingbutpip/wikis/home) is going to be the primary repository of documentation.

(Note: can't make a relative link from a branch to the wiki. This shoudl be filed as a GitLab BUG.)
