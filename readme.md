**Anything But [Pip](https://wiki.hypertwins.org/Pip)** (ABP) is the working title for a project to meet the immediate resource needs of the team so that we can spend more time moving forward with mission-related work and less time struggling to meet basic existential needs.

Tagline: **Fund the revolution by using our services (instead of funding the plutonomy by using theirs).**
